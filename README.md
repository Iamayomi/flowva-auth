Flowva Authentication App
Flowva Authentication App is a modern, responsive web application built with React, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS. It provides a user-friendly interface for authentication, including sign-in, sign-up, and password reset functionalities. The project uses Create React App for a robust development setup and incorporates accessibility best practices.
Features

Sign-In Form: Allows users to log in with email and password, with a toggle to show/hide the password.
Sign-Up Form: Enables user registration with email, password, and password confirmation, featuring a password strength meter.
Forgot Password Form: Provides a form to request a password reset link via email.
Google Sign-In Simulation: Simulates Google OAuth login with a redirect message.
Responsive Design: Optimized for both desktop and mobile devices using Tailwind CSS.
Accessibility: Implements semantic HTML and accessible controls, with buttons styled as links for navigation actions.
Type Safety: Uses TypeScript for strict typing and improved developer experience.
Modular Components: Organized component structure for reusability and maintainability.

Prerequisites
Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

Node.js (version 16 or higher)
npm (version 7 or higher) or yarn (optional)
A modern web browser (e.g., Chrome, Firefox)

Installation

Clone the Repository (if applicable, or create the project structure manually):
git clone <https://github.com/Iamayomi/flowva-auth.git>
cd flowva-auth

Set Up Project Files: Ensure the following files are in place as per the project structure (see Project Structure below). You can copy the files from the provided artifacts:

package.json
tsconfig.json
tailwind.config.js
public/index.html
src/\* (including index.tsx, App.tsx, styles/global.css, types.ts, and components/)

Install Dependencies: Run the following command to install all required packages:
npm install

Start the Development Server: Launch the Create React App development server:
npm start

The application will be available at http://localhost:3000.

Usage

Development:

Run npm start to start the development server with hot reloading.
Open http://localhost:3000 in your browser to view the app.
Modify the source files in src/ to update the application.

Building for Production:

Run npm run build to create an optimized production build in the build/ directory.
Serve the build/ directory using a static server (e.g., npx serve build).

Testing:

Run npm test to execute tests (if test files are added, as Create React App includes Jest by default).
Note: The current project does not include test files but supports testing setup.

Linting:

The project uses Create React App's default ESLint configuration with eslint-plugin-jsx-a11y for accessibility checks.
Run npm run lint (if configured) to check for linting issues.
